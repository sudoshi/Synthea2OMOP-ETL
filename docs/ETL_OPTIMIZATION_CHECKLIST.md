# ETL Optimization Checklist

This checklist provides guidance for optimizing the Synthea to OMOP ETL process. Use it to identify and implement performance improvements.

## Database Optimization

- [ ] **Connection Pooling**
  - [ ] Implement connection pooling to reduce connection overhead
  - [ ] Configure appropriate pool size based on workload
  - [ ] Add connection timeout and retry logic

- [ ] **PostgreSQL Configuration**
  - [x] Increase `work_mem` for complex operations (sort, join, etc.)
  - [x] Increase `maintenance_work_mem` for index creation
  - [x] Set `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` for parallel query execution
  - [x] Adjust `shared_buffers` for caching frequently accessed data
  - [x] Consider setting `synchronous_commit = OFF` for bulk loading
  - [x] Optimize `effective_cache_size` based on available memory

- [ ] **Table and Index Management**
  - [ ] Drop indexes before bulk loading
  - [ ] Create indexes after data loading
  - [ ] Use appropriate index types (B-tree, GIN, etc.)
  - [ ] Consider partitioning large tables
  - [ ] Run VACUUM ANALYZE after bulk operations

## ETL Process Optimization

- [ ] **Parallel Processing**
  - [ ] Identify independent ETL steps
  - [ ] Implement parallel execution of independent steps
  - [ ] Configure optimal number of workers based on CPU cores
  - [ ] Add dependency management for sequential steps

- [ ] **Bulk Loading**
  - [ ] Use PostgreSQL COPY command for bulk inserts
  - [ ] Batch inserts for large datasets
  - [ ] Optimize batch size for memory and performance
  - [ ] Consider using temporary tables for staging

- [ ] **Data Transformation**
  - [ ] Move transformations to SQL where possible
  - [ ] Optimize complex SQL queries
  - [ ] Use appropriate data types to reduce storage
  - [ ] Implement efficient string operations

- [ ] **Memory Management**
  - [ ] Process data in chunks to reduce memory usage
  - [ ] Implement streaming for large files
  - [ ] Release resources promptly after use
  - [ ] Monitor memory usage during ETL

## Code Optimization

- [ ] **Python Code**
  - [ ] Use efficient data structures (dictionaries, sets)
  - [ ] Implement generator functions for large datasets
  - [ ] Optimize loops and list comprehensions
  - [ ] Profile code to identify bottlenecks

- [ ] **SQL Optimization**
  - [ ] Use prepared statements for repeated queries
  - [ ] Optimize JOIN operations
  - [ ] Use appropriate SQL functions
  - [ ] Implement efficient subqueries

- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - [ ] Implement robust error handling
  - [ ] Add retry logic for transient failures
  - [ ] Log detailed error information
  - [ ] Implement transaction management

## Monitoring and Logging

- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**
  - [ ] Track execution time for each ETL step
  - [ ] Monitor database performance metrics
  - [ ] Implement progress reporting
  - [ ] Set up alerts for long-running operations

- [ ] **Logging**
  - [ ] Implement structured logging
  - [ ] Log appropriate detail level
  - [ ] Include context information in logs
  - [ ] Rotate log files to manage size

## Testing and Validation

- [ ] **Data Validation**
  - [ ] Verify record counts between source and target
  - [ ] Implement data quality checks
  - [ ] Validate transformed data against business rules
  - [ ] Check for data consistency across tables

- [ ] **Performance Testing**
  - [ ] Benchmark ETL performance
  - [ ] Test with various data volumes
  - [ ] Identify performance regression
  - [ ] Document performance metrics

## Advanced Optimizations

- [ ] **Incremental Processing**
  - [ ] Implement change data capture
  - [ ] Process only new or changed records
  - [ ] Maintain state between ETL runs
  - [ ] Optimize incremental update logic

- [ ] **Caching**
  - [ ] Cache frequently used lookup data
  - [ ] Implement efficient cache invalidation
  - [ ] Use memory-efficient caching structures
  - [ ] Consider distributed caching for large datasets

- [ ] **Distributed Processing**
